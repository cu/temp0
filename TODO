This is the current list of things that need to be done with the
c0ntr0l application.  You'll have my undying love and gratitude if you
knock a few items off of this list. 


Shaving a yak:
--------------
- Add a pattern browser for manipulating the patterns in memory via the GUI.


A solid day of work:
--------------------
- Test on Linux
- Test on Windows


Afternoon in a coffee shop
--------------------------
- Setup the py2exe build system


Low hanging fruit:
------------------
- Make the background of the icon transparent (or make a new one entirely)



Programming Tasks and BUGS
--------------------------

In addition to the high level todo items above, there are several tasks that 
need to be complete before the software is released at all.  This includes both
bugs and incomplete features.


- Fix and test the pattern length control.  Change the behavior so
  that it doesn't blow away the pattern if you shorten, then lengthen it
  again.

- Implement other commapi controls. (Set tempo, sync, start/stop, etc)

- Implement the pattern play control area.

- Think about pattern librarian style features that could be added.  

- Implement the proper tab behavior in the GUI.

- See if the textvalidators can be more flexible in letting you
  overwrite existing data.  Make this work in conjunction with tabbing
  around the window and highlighting text.

- After a pattern is loaded, keyboard focus should be on the pattern
  edit grid (and maybe this should always be true...)

- Clean everything up!
